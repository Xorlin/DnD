            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of bodY,. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Furious Tempers.</i></b> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wr-ath in an instant- as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Gruesome Gluttons.</i></b> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, hal flings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Greedy Collectors.</i></b> An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous "treasure" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Legendary Stupidity.</i></b> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Primitive Wanderers.</i></b> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an. ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none;"><b>Claws.</b> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.</p>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none;color: black">Description</h3><hr>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Deadly Ferocity.</i></b> The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness. and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Consummate Predators.</i></b> An owl bear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Savage Companions.</i></b> Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owl bear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none">Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night. Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost giants sometimes keep owl bears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 5px;text-decoration: none"><b><i>Owlbear Origins.</i></b> Scholars have long debated the origins of the owl bear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owl bears have always existed in the Feywild.</p>
