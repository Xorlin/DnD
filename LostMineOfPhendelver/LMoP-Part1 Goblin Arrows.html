    <p>The adventure begins as the player characters are escorting a wagon full of provisions and supplies from Neverwinter to Phandalin. The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they're a half-day's march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.</p>
    <p>Read the boxed text when you're ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagon load of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found "something big," and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Haliwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to "take care of business." </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail. </p>

    <p>Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already.</li>
      <li>Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player's character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure's backstory.</li>
      <li>Ask the players to give you the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren's wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like. </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <!------------------------>
    <button class="accordion"><h4 style="margin-top: 5px">Driving The Wagon</h4></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.</p>
    <p>The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.</p>

    <p>Four <b><a href="LMoP-Appendix B Monsters.html#Goblin" target="_blank">goblins</a></b> are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.</p>
    <p>This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the <b><a href="LMoP-Appendix B Monsters.html#Goblin" target="_blank">goblin</a></b> stat block in <a href="LMoP-Appendix B Monsters.html" target="_blank">appendix B</a>. Since the goblins are hiding, you'll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.</li>
      <li>Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll a d20, add the goblins' Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins.:check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH09-Combat.html#Surprise" target="_blank">Surprise</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>).</li>
      <li>Use the initiative rules in the <i>Player Handbook</i> to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper.</li>
      <li>When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH09-Combat.html" target="_blank">Combat</a>," in the <i>Player Handbook</i>.</li>
      <li>When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="panel">
    <p>In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the <a href="#Cragmaw Hideout">Cragmaw Hideout</a>. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at <a href="LMoP-Part2 Phalandin.html#Barthens Provisions">Barthen's Provisions</a>, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins' trail.</p>
    <p>The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the "<a href="#What Goblins Know">What the Goblins Know</a>" sidebar). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the "<a href="#Goblin Trail">Goblin Trail</a>" section).</p>
    <p>The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin.

    <button class="accordion"><h3 id="Goblin Trail" style="margin-top: 5px">Goblin Trail</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.</p>
    <p>The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.</p>
    <p>The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the <a href="#Cragmaw Hideout">Cragmaw Hideout</a> (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.</p>
    <p><b><i>Snare.</i></b> About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord. (See the appendix in the <i>Player Handbook</i> for the effect of being <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-APA-Conditions.html#Restrained" target="_blank">restrained</a>.) A character who isn't carefully lowered down takes Id6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.</p>
    <p><b><i>Pit.</i></b> Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking Id6 bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h3 style="margin-top: 5px">Awarding Experience Points</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragrnaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h2 id="Cragmaw Hideout" style="margin-top: 5px">Cragmaw Hideout</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragrnaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.</p>
    <p></p>
    <a href="images/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg" target="_blank"><img width="1200" src="images/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg"></a>
    <p></p>
    <p>The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.</p>

    <p>The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.</p>
    <p><b><i>Ceilings.</i></b> Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.</p>
    <p><b><i>Light.</i></b> Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.</i></p>
    <p><b><i>Rubble.</i></b> Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH09-Combat.html#Difficult Terrain" target="_blank">Difficult Terrain</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>).</p>
    <p><b><i>Sound.</i></b> The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren't listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.</p>
    <p><b><i>Stalagmites.</i></b> These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH09-Combat.html#Cover" target="_blank">Cover</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>).</p>
    <p><b><i>Stream.</i></b> The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.</p>

              <li>Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago.

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM's eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see-hence the need for secrecy.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px"><b><i>Scale and Grid.</i></b> A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things. Indoor maps use grid squares that are either 5 feet on a side or 10 feet on a side.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px"><b><i>Compass Rose.</i></b> A compass rose comes in handy when you're describing locations. For instance, you might need to tell players about "barrels along the north wall" or "the staircase descending to the west."</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h4 style="margin-top: 5px">Role Playing Sildar</h4></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Sildar Hallwinter is a kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Water deep. He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelafds.</p>
    <p>Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accpmpany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of larno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to larno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.</p>
    <p>Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the "<a href="LMoP-Introduction.html#Background">Background</a>" section to the players at this time.)</li>
      <li>Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.</li>
      <li>Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the "<a href="#What the Goblins Know">What the Goblins Know</a>" sidebar on page 8.)</li>
      <li>Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: -80px;margin-right: -150px;margin-top: 5px">
              <li>Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</li>
              <li>An NPC won't deliberately put himself or herself in harm's way unless there's a good reason to do so.</li>
              <li>An NPC won't treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which ones the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the party members.</li>
              <li>In a combat encounter, keep the NPC's actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</li>
              <li>If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share ofthe XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</li>
              <li>NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as doing so makes sense for those goals.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>It's also possible that players might decide to do something different, such as striking out in search of Cragmaw Castle (in part 3 of the adventure). If that's the case, skip ahead to that section.</p>

    <p>Exploring the Cragmaw Hideout and defeating Klarg and his allies completes a story milestone; Award each character 275 XP. This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain 2nd level.</p>
    <p>Level advancement rules for characters are provided on loose sheets included in this set. Hand these sheets to the players, and allow them to advance their characters to 2nd level before continuing the adventure. Make sure they've recorded their XP totals on their character sheets.</p>
    <p>In the next part of the adventure, you'll award XP differently. The characters will earn experience points based on the monsters and traps they overcome, the NPCs they interact with, and the goals they accomplish.</p>
    <p>If the adventurers come up with a non-violent way to neutralize the threat that a monster poses, award them experience points as if they had defeated it.</p>
