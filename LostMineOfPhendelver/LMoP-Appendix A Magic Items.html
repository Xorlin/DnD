    <p>Every adventure holds the promise-but not a guarantee of finding one or more magic items. <i>Lost Mine of Phandelver</i> contains an assortment of magic items that hints at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D. See the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> for many more items.

    <button class="accordion"><h2 style="margin-top: 5px">Using A Magic Item</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the identify spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.</p>
    <p>Certain magic items require a user to <b>attune</b> to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn an item's properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.</p>
    <p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest.</p>
    <p>Your attunement to an item ends when the item has been more than 100 feet away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h4 style="margin-top: 5px" id="Spell Scroll">Spell Scroll</h4></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.</p>
    <p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>
    <p>Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.</p>
