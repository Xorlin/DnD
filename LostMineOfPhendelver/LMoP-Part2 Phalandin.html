    <div class="panel">
    <p>The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same ore horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</p>
    <p>In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins-crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.</p>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the "<a href="#Town Masters Hall">Townmaster's Hall</a>" section).</p>
    <p>During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the "<a href="#Town Description">Town Description</a>"section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.</p>
    <p>Some locales the characters should visit include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Barthen's Provisions.</b> If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the "<a href="LMoP-Introduction.html#Adventure Hook">Meet Me in Phandalin</a>" adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.</li>
      <li><b>Lionshield Coster.</b> If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.</li>
      <li><b>Stonehill Inn.</b> If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.</li>
    </ul>

    <button class="accordion"><h2 id ="Encounters in Phandalin" style="margin-top: 5px">Encounters in Phandalin</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>When the characters explore Phandalin, you don't need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you're directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.</p>
    <p>To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, "There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?" When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, illt~ the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.</p>
    <p><b><i>The Stonehill Inn.</i></b> If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are "pointers" who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.</p>
    <p><b><i>Redbrand Ruffians.</i></b> Sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the "Red brand Ruffians" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.</p>
    <p><b><i>Finding Cragmaw Castle.</i></b> The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.</p>

    <div class="panel">
    <p>If you're not sure how to run an NPC, a good way to start is to have the character introduce himself or herself, welcome the adventurers to Phandalin, and ask who they are and what they want. You don't need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here's some advice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Relax.</b> Don't worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).</li>
      <li><b>Get inside the NPCs' minds.</b> Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.</li>
      <li><b>Mug it up.</b> Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together-whatever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.</li>
      <li><b>Try different voices.</b> Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.</li>
      <li><b>Keep the game moving.</b> Let the players steer the interactions with the NPCs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The characters have no reason to fight ordinary townsfolk. Hence, no game statistics are provided for them. If statistics become necessary, use the commoner stat block to represent an adult NPC of any race.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h2 id="Town Description" style="margin-top: 5px">Town Description</h2></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you'll have to take turns running each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter potentially more dangerous.</p>
    <p>The following sections detail specific locations in town.</p>
    </div>

            <p style="margin-left: 5px;margin-right: 0px;margin-top: 5px">In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.</p>

    <p>This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see "Food, Drink, and Lodging" in the <i>Player Handbook</i> for pricing. (The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)</p>
    <p>The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.</p>
    </div>
    <!------------------------>
    <button class="accordion"><h4 id="Rumors" style="margin-top: 5px">Rumors</h4></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town. NPCs present in the Stonehill Inn and the rumors they pass on include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Narth, an old farmer: "Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted." (See the "<a href="#Shrine of Luck">Shrine of Luck</a>" section for more information.)</li>
      <li>Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: "Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, is a former adventurer." (See the "<a href="#Edermath Orchard">Edermath Orchard</a>" section for more information.)</li>
      <li>Lanar, a miner: "Ore raiders have been seen on the east end of Triboar Trail. The town master is looking for someone to run them off." (See the "<a href="#Town Masters Hall">Town Master's Hall</a>" section for more information.)</li>
      <li>Trilena, the innkeeper's wife: "Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to the Redbrands a ten day ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. The Redbrands grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing too." (Unknown to Trilena and the other townsfolk, the Redbrands took Thel's wife and children to their secret hideout.)</li>
      <li>Pip, Toblen's young son: "Qelline Alderleaf's son Carp said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him." (See the "<a href="#Alderleaf Farm">Alderleaf Farm</a>" section for more information.)</li>
      <li>Freda, a weaver: "The Redbrands hassle every business in town, except for the Phandalin Miner's Exchange. They don't want trouble with Halia Thornton, who runs it." (See the "<a href="#Phandalin Miners Exchange">Phandalin Miner's Exchange</a>" section for more information.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These leads should point the characters toward opportunities for adventure in and around Phandalin. In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the <a href="#The Sleeping Giant">Sleeping Giant</a> tap house at the east end of town-and that the ruffians are trouble.</p>
    </div>
    <!------------------------>
    <button class="accordion"><h3 id="Barthens Provisions" style="margin-top: 5px">Barthen's Provisions</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Barthen's is the biggest trading post in Phandalin. Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH05-Equipment.html#Adventuring Gear" target="_blank">Adventuring Gear</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the <a href="#Lionshield Coster">Lionshield Coster</a> (see that section).</p>
    <p>The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks (Ander and Thistle) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn't around.</p>
    <p><b><i>Delivering the Supplies.</i></b> If the characters began play with the "<a href="LMoP-Introduction.html#Adventure Hook">Meet Me in Phandalin</a>" adventure hook, their orders are to deliver the wagon of supplies to Barthen's. Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn't already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the "Background" section at the start of the adventure.</p>
    <p>Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. Barthen hasn't seen them in a ten day and expects the brothers to return "any day now" to resupply. What Barthen doesn't know is that Tharden is dead and Nundro is a prisoner in the mine. See part 4, the "<a href="LMoP-Part4 Wave Echo Cave.html">Wave Echo Cave</a>" section, for more information.</p>
    <p><b><i>Barthen's News.</i></b> If the characters ask Barthen how business is going, the shopkeeper tells them that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the townmaster's authority. If the characters seem of a mind to do something about it, he tells them that the Redbrands frequent the <a href="#The Sleeping Giant">Sleeping Giant</a> tap house.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h3 id="Edermath Orchard" style="margin-top: 5px">Edermath Orchard</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Daran Edermath is a retired adventurer who lives in a tidy little cottage beside an apple orchard. A fit, silverhaired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.</p>
    <p>Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others. Though he is no longer active in the order, he keeps an eye on happenings around Phandalin. He is happy to trade news with fellow adventurers, especially those who appear to hold to these virtues.</p>
    <p>Daran is concerned about the Redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the ruffians a lesson. He tells the characters that it's time someone took a stand against the Redbrands' leader, Glasstaff. Daran knows the Redbrands hang around the <a href="#The Sleeping Giant">Sleeping Giant</a> tap house, but he can also tell the characters that the main Redbrand safe house lies under Tresendar Manor, the ruin at the east edge of town. (See the "Tresendar Manor" section for more information.)</p>
    <p><b><i>Quest: Old Owl Trouble.</i></b> Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandalin that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Wel!. More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and what they're up to. Daran knows that the ruins are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous magic might be dormant there. If the party pursues this quest, see "<a href="LMoP-Part3 The Spiders Web.html#Old Owl Well">Old Owl Well</a>".</p>

    <p>If the party deals with the Redbrands and investigates Old Owl Well, Daran Edermath privately approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Order of the Gauntlet.

    <p>This building is owned by the Lionshields, a merchant company based in the city of Yartar, over a hundred miles to the east. They ship finished goods to Phandalin and other small settlements throughout the region, but this outpost has been hard hit by banditry. The most recent Lionshield caravan due in Phandalin never arrived. (It was attacked and its cargo captured by the Cragmaw goblins.)</p>
    <p>The master of the Phandalin post is a sharp-tongued human woman of thirty-five named Linene Graywind. She knows that bandits have raided Lionshield caravans, but she doesn't know who is responsible.</p>
    <p>In a back room, Linene keeps a supply of armor and weapons, all of which are for sale to interested buyers. (For prices, see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH05-Equipment.html#Adventuring Gear" target="_blank">Adventuring Gear</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town. Among those with whom she refuses to do business are the Redbrands. She warns the characters that the ruffians are trouble and advises them to avoid the <a href="#The Sleeping Giant">Sleeping Giant</a> tap house.</p>
    <p>Recovered Goods. If the characters return the stolen goods found in <a href="LMoP-Part1 Goblin Arrows.html#Klargs Cave">area 8</a> of the Cragmaw Hideout (or if they left the goods but reveal where they can be found), Linene gives them a reward of 50 gp and promises to help the adventurers any way she can.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h3 id="Phandalin Miners Exchange" style="margin-top: 5px">Phandalin Miner's Exchange</h3></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>The Miner's Exchange is a trading post where local miners have their valuable finds weighed, measured, and paid out. In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.</p>
    <p>The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence.</p>
    <p>Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her. Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them. She suggests the goblin might know the location. She leverages this information to try to persuade the characters into helping her deal with the Redbrands.</p>
    <p><b><i>Quest: Halia'sJob Offer.</i></b> If approached by characters she believes she can control, Halia explains that the Redbrands are a problem. She tells how the ruffians loiter around the <a href="#The Sleeping Giant">Sleeping Giant</a> tap house and have a base under Tresendar Manor, on the east edge of town. She then offers the characters 100 gp to eliminate the Redbrand leader, whom the outlaws call Glasstaff, and bring her any correspondence found in the leader's quarters. Halia doesn't reveal that she wants to take over the Redbrand operation herself. A DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates she has ulterior motives for wanting the Redbrand leader dead.</p>

    <p>If the party disposes of the Redbrand leader, Halia Thornton approaches certain members of the group to urge them to join the Zhentarim. She speaks with those who share the Zhentarim's pursuits, such as wealth and power. Even if the party wipes out the Redbrand gang, Halia might still extend the offer in an effort to gain friends (and spies) within the party.

    <p>A wise female halfling of forty-five, Qelline Alderleaf is a pragmatic farmer who seems to know everything that goes on in town. She is a kind host, and is willing to let the characters stay in her hayloft if they don't want to stay at the Stonehill Inn.</p>
    <p><b><i>Carp's Story.</i></b> Qelline's son, Carp, is a spirited and precocious halfling lad of ten years. He is enchanted by the idea of being an adventurer and says that he was playing in the woods near Tresendar Manor when he found a secret tunnel in a thicket. A couple of "big ugly bandits" came out of the tunnel when he was there, and met with a pair of Redbrands. They didn't see him, but it was close. Carp thinks that the bandits have a secret lair under the old manor house. He can take the characters to the tunnel or provide them with directions to the location. The tunnel leads to area 8 in the Redbrand hideout.</p>
    <p><b><i>Quest: Reidoth the Druid.</i></b> Qelline is a longtime friend of a druid named Reidoth. If she figures out that the characters are looking for specific sites in the area, such as Cragmaw Castle or Wave Echo Cave, she suggests that they visit Reidoth and ask for his help, "since there's not an inch of the land he doesn't know." She tells the characters that Reidoth recently set out for the ruins of a town called Thundertree, just west of the Neverwinter Wood. The ruins are about fifty miles northwest of Phandalin, and she provides directions so the characters can easily find the place.

    <p>Phandalin's only temple is a small shrine made of stones taken from the nearby ruins. It is dedicated to Tymora, goddess of luck and good fortune.</p>
    <p>The shrine is in the care of a scholarly acolyte named Sister Garaele, a zealous young elf who despairs of ever ridding Phandalin of the Redbrands. Sister Garaele is a member of the Harpers, a scattered network of adventurers and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power. The Harpers gather information throughout the land to thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too strong. They aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed. Sister Garaele regularly reports to her superiors on events in and around Phandalin.</p>
    <p><b><i>Quest: The Banshee's Bargain.</i></b> Recently, Garaele's superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted her to persuade a banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele sought out Agatha in her lair, but the creature did not appear for her.</p>
    <p>Garaele desires an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift, a jeweled silver comb, and persuade the creature to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the quest to the characters and offers them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts.

    <p>Phandalin has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as town master each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current town master is a male human banker named Harbin Wester-a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really."</p>
    <p>The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.</p>
    <p id="Wyvren Tor Quest"><b><i>Quest: Orc Trouble.</i></b> Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor.

    <p><b><i>Quest: Finding Cragmaw Castle.</i></b> After resting at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster's hall. As an agent of the Lords' Alliance, his goal is to bring law and order to Phandalin. As such, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production, believing that bringing prosperity to the region will help civilize the town.</p>
    <p>Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gp reward if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the tribe's chieftain. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see "<a href="LMoP-Part3 The Spiders Web.html#Wilderness Encounters">Wilderness Encounters</a>" in the "Triboar Trail" section of part 3).</p>
    <p><b><i>Quest: Finding Iarno.</i></b> After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords' Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno-or what's left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as "a short, darkbearded human wizard in his thirties."</p>
    <p>Unknown to Sildar, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the alias Glasstaff to conceal his identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have the wizard captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno's fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 gp for eliminating the Redbrand threat.</p>

A creature attempting to skirt around the pit using one of these ledges must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>
    <p>A creature that triggers the trap or fails the Dexterity check to skirt around the edge of the pit must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to catch the edge. On a failed save, the creature falls 20 feet to the dirt floor of the pit, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone.</p>

    <p>The guardian of this cave is a <b><a href="LMoP-Appendix B Monsters.html#Nothic" target="_blank">nothic</a></b>-an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.</p>
    <p>The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature's stat block) to discern the characters' secrets.</p>
    <p>The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn't above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn't actually talking but rather filling the characters' heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the "<a href="#What the Redbrands Know">What the Redbrands Know</a>" sidebar.</p>
    <p><b><i>Bridges.</i></b> These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can discern that the construction is faulty with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse.</p>
    <p><b><i>Crevasse.</i></b> This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see "<a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH09-Combat.html#Difficult Terrain" target="_blank">Difficult Terrain</a>" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>).</p>
    <p>The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a detect magic spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.</p>
    <p>Currently heaped at the bottom among broken and wellgnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. The outlaws left his corpse here for the nothic to feed on.</p>

    p>The nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the north bridge. The chest can't be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two <a href="LMoP-Appendix A Magic Items.html#Potion of Healing" target="_blank"><i>potions of healing</i></a>, and a <a href="LMoP-Appendix A Magic Items.html#Spell Scroll" target="_blank">scroll</a> of <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Augury" target="_blank"><i>augury</i></a>.</p>

The sword is inscribed with the name "Talon," and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.</p>
    <p>Sir Aldith died fighting off the ores that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor. Talon was lost here until the nothic found it.</p>

    <p>The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve Iarno.

    <p>Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn't think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as' much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all.</p>
    <p>If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn't remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it's up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.</p>
    <p>Characters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while. See the "<a href="LMoP-Part1 Goblin Arrows.html#NPC Party Members">NPC Party Members</a>" sidebar for advice on how to run Droop as a member of the party.</p>

In addition, Urmon records that a magic mace named <i><a href="LMoP-Part4 Wave Echo Cave.html#Lightbringer">Lightbringer</a></i> was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the rnages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver's Pact. The mace was lost when Wave Echo Cave and its mine vanished from history. (Characters might find the mace in part 4, "<a href="LMoP-Part4 Wave Echo Cave.html">Wave Echo Cave.</a>")</p>

In his haste, Iarno leaves behind a letter from the Black Spider (see the "Developments" section) and neglects to make sure the secret door is closed all the way. Characters gain advantage on ability checks made to find the slightly ajar secret door (see "Advantage and Disadvantage" in the <i>Player Handbook</i>). For more information on secret doors, see the "General Features" section (page 20).</p>
    <p>If he manages to escape, Iarno flees to <a href="#Cellar">area 1</a> (through <a href="#Storeroom and Work Area">area 7</a> and <a href="#Crevasse">area 8</a>) and grabs the satchel hidden in the cistern there. If the nothic is still alive in <a href="#Crevasse">area 8</a>, Iarno instructs it to waylay any pursuers. If the characters catch up to him, Iarno quaffs the potion of invisibility in the satchel and flees the hideout. At your discretion, he could reappear later in the adventure.</p>

    <button class="accordion"><h4 style="margin-top: 5px">Roleplaying Iarno</h4></button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>A former member of the Lords' Alliance, Iarno seized an opportunity in Phandalin to line his own pockets. Originally tasked with setting up a constabulary, the mage instead assembled a group of outlaws and local ruffians to secure his own position in town.</p>
    <p>Iarno knew of the Black Spider through his contacts in the Lords' Alliance and brokered a meeting. The drow promised to share the secrets and wealth of the Forge of Spells with the wizard in exchange for his help and loyalty.</p>
    <p>Iarno puts on airs of gentility and courteous manners, addressing his ruffians as "my good gentlemen," and referring to sordid acts such as kidnapping or arson as "that unpleasant little business" or "those unfortunate events." He refers to the characters as "guests" and expresses regret that he cannot provide suitable entertainment for their visit. Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.</p>
    <p>If threatened, Iarno uses his <i><a href="LMoP-Appendix A Magic Items.html#Staff of Defense" target="_blank">Staff of Defense</a></i> to cast <i><a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Mage Armor" target="_blank">Mage Armor</a></i> on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see. Iarno's stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the rule book. Iarno uses the <i>shield</i> power of his staff for added protection.</p>
    <p>If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and "arrange for his freedom."</p>
    <p>If he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).</li>
      <li>The Black Spider sent three bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them. The bugbears know the way to Wave Echo Cave, but Iarno does not.</li>
      <li>The Black Spider is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells. Dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact used the magical forge to fashion powerful magic items.</li>
      <li>No other members of the Lords' Alliance know of Iarno's betrayal.</li>

    <p>Various papers and notes are stacked neatly on the desk, mostly consisting of Iarno's written orders to apothecaries and alchemists in nearby settlements for more materials for his workshop. The characters also find a letter signed with the Black Spider's symbol.</p>

    <p>If Iarno is taken into custody, Sildar Hallwinter arranges to have the wizard incarcerated in the townmaster's hall until he can be safely transported back to Neverwinter. Whether Iarno stands trial for his crimes is beyond the scope of this adventure. The Black Spider is too preoccupied to meddle in the wizard's fate.</p>
