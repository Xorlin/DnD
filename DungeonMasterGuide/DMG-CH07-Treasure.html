    <h3>Magic Items A-Z</h3>
    <p>Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item's description gives the item's name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Adamantine Armor">Adamantine Armor</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon</p>
    <p>This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Alchemy Jug">Alchemy Jug</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.</p>
    <p>You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named. Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)</p>
    <p>You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hit a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Amulet of Health">Amulet of Health</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location">Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Amulet of the Planes">Amulet of the Planes</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1- 60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61- 100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Animated Shield">Animated Shield</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Armor (shield), very rare (requires atttinement)</p>
    <p>While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Apparatus of Kwalish">Apparatus of Kwalish</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, legendary</p>
    <p>This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.</p>
    <p>The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:</p>
    <p><b>Armor Class:</b> 20<br>
    <b>Hit Points:</b> 200<br>
    <b>Speed:</b> 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)<br>
    <b>Damage Immunities:</b> poison, psychic</p>
    <p>To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>
    <p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>
    <p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.</p>

    <p>While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly.</h>
    <p><b>Curse.</b> This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic: removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to two of the three damage type associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Arrow-Catching Shield">Arrow-Catching Shield</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Arrow of Slaying">Arrow of Slaying</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (arrow), very rare</p>
    <p>An <i>arrow of slaying</i> is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an <i>arrow of slaying</i> takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.</p>
    <p>Once an <i>arrow of slaying</i> deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.</p>
    <p>Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.</p>

    <h4 id="Bag of Beans">Bag of Beans</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs &frac12; pound plus &frac14; pound for each bean it contains.</p>
    <p>If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
    <p>If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.</p>

    <h4 id="Bag of Devouring">Bag of Devouring</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, very rare</p>
    <p>This bag superficially resembles a <i>bag of holding</i> but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.</p>
    <p>The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.</p>
    <p>Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.</p>
    <p>If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Bag of Holding">Bag of Holding</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
    <p>If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>
    <p>Placing a <i>bag of holding</i> inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's handy haversack, <i>portable hole</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Bag of Tricks">Bag of Tricks</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs &frac12; pound.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag's color. See the Monster Manual for the creature's statistics.</p>
    <p>The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>
    <p>Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <p>This small black sphere measures &frac34; of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 <i>beads of force</i> are found together.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.</p>
    <p>An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.</p>

      <li>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you're capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.</p>
    <p>If you aren't a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.</p>
    <p>If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, legendary</p>
    <p>This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to plane: determined by the DM.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.</p>
    <p>The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expend: 1 charge. The cube regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

    <h4 id="Daerns Instant Fortress">Daern's Instant Fortress</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>You can use an action to place this l-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.</p>
    <p>The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Knock" target="_blank"><i>Knock</i></a> spell and similar magic, such as that of a <a href="#Chime of Opening"><i>Chime of Opening</i></a>.</p>
    <p>Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10dl0 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.</p>
    <p>The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.</p>

    <h4 id="Dagger of Venom">Dagger of Venom</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (dagger), rare</p>
    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Dancing Sword">Dancing Sword</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The -word uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.</p>
    <p>While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause rhe sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
    <p>After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it ies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.</p>

    <h4 id="Decanter of Endless Water">Decanter of Endless Water</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Stream" produces 1 gallon of water.</li>
      <li>"Fountain" produces 5 gallons of water.</li>
      <li>"Geyser" produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn't being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.</li>

    <h4 id="Deck of Illusions">Deck of Illusions</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.</p>
    <p>The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.</p>
    <p>An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature (as presented in the <i>Monster Manual</i>), except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.</p>
    <p>The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.</p>

    <p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.</p>
    <p>Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.</p>

          <p style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 5px">In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally.

    <p><b><i>Balance.</i></b> Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p>
    <p><b><i>Comet.</i></b> If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.</p>
    <p><b><i>Donjon.</i></b> You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p>
    <p><b><i>Euryale.</i></b> The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p>
    <p><b><i>The Fates.</i></b> Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p>
    <p><b><i>Flames.</i></b> A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.</p>
    <p><b><i>Fool.</b></i> You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p>
    <p><b><i>Gem.</i></b> Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.</p>
    <p><b><i>Idiot.</i></b> Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.</p>
    <p><b><i>Jester.</i></b> You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p>
    <p><b><i>Key.</i></b> A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.</p>
    <p><b><i>Knight.</i></b> You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p>
    <p><b><i>Moon.</i></b> You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.</p>
    <p><b><i>Rogue.</i></b> A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.</p>
    <p><b><i>Ruin.</i></b> All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p>
    <p><b><i>Skull.</i></b> You summon an <a href="../MonsterManual/MM-Monsters A.html#Avatar of Death" target="_blank">Avatar of Death</a>-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.</p>
    <p><b><i>Star.</i></b> Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.</p>
    <p><b><i>Sun.</i></b> You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.</p>
    <p><b><i>Talons.</i></b> Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.</p>
    <p><b><i>Throne.</i></b> You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as. yours.</p>
    <p><b><i>Vizier.</i></b> At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.</p>
    <p><b><i>The Void.</i></b> This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.</p>

    <p>The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect ~til the start of your next turn, although you must hold e sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.</p>

    <h4 id="Dimensional Shackles">Dimensional Shackles</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation r travel to a different plane of existence. They won't prevent the creature from passing-through an interdimensional portal.</p>
    <p>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Dragon Scale Mail">Dragon Scale Mail</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.</p>
    <p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).</p>
    <p>Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <h4 id="Dragon Slayer">Dragon Slayer</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any sword), rare</p>
    <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.</p>

    <h4 id="Driftglobe">Driftglobe</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This small sphere of thick glass weighs 1 pound. If you are within 60 feet of it, you can speak its command word and cause it to emanate the light or daylight spell. Once used, the daylight effect can't be used again until the next dawn. You can speak another command word as an action to make the illuminated globe rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The globe hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you mpve more than 60 feet from the hovering globe, it follows you until it is within 60 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the globe sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive, and its light winks out.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Dust of Disappearance">Dust of Disappearance</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Dust of Dryness">Dust of Dryness</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet's magic. An elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the teleport spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Hewards Handy Haversack">Heward's Handy Haversack</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.</p>
    <p>Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.</p>
    <p>The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
    <p>Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, <i>portable hole</i>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can·I be reopened.</p>

    <h4 id="Holy Avenger">Holy Avenger</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)</p>
    <p>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.</p>
    <p>While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.</p>

    <h4 id="Horn of Blasting">Horn of Blasting</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderou blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600  Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature ra kes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.</p>
    <p>Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.</p>

    <h4 id="Horn of Valhalla">Horn of Valhalla</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)</p>
    <p>You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane ofYsgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the berserker statistics 'rom the Monster Manual. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>
    <p>Four types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as £he requirement for its use. The DM chooses the horn's rype or determines it randomly.</p>

    <p>These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the cre.ature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.</p>

Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.</p>

    <p>An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of it kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. The following table lists the spells common to all instruments, as well as the spells specific to each one and its rarity. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.</p>
    <p>When you use the instrument to cast a spell that causes targets to become charmed on a failed save, the targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect applies whether you are using the instrument as the source of the spell or as a spellcasting focus.</p>

    <h4 id="Ioun Stone">Ioun Stone</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>An Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.</p>
    <p>When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of ld3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.</p>
    <p>A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Absorption (Very Rare).</i></b> While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</p>
    <p><b><i>Agility(Very Rare).</i></b> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Awareness (Rare).</i></b> You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Fortitude (Very Rare).</i></b> Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Greater Absorption (Legendary).</i></b> While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</p>
    <p><b><i>Insight (Very Rare).</i></b> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Intellect (Very Rare).</i></b> Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Leadership (Very Rare).</i></b> Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Mastery (Legendary).</i></b> Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Protection (Rare).</i></b> You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Regeneration (Legendary).</i></b> You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.</p>
    <p><b><i>Reserve (Rare).</i></b> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains ld4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the DM.</p>
    <p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
    <p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
    <p><b><i>Strength (Very Rare).</i></b> Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
    <p><b><i>Sustenance (Rare).</i></b> You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Iron Bands of Bilarro">Iron Bands of Bilarro</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.</p>
    <p>Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.</p>
    <p>A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.</p>
    <p>Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Iron Flask">Iron Flask</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, legendary</p>
    <p>This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.</p>
    <p>An <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Identify" target="_blank"><i>identify</i></a> spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or determined randomly.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, very rare</p>
    <p>When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
    <p>If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.</p>
    <p>Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.</p>
    <p>An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.</p>
    <p>If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.</p>
    <p>While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.</p>
    <p>In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.</p>

    <p>This necklace has ld6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 6 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Fireball" target="_blank"><i>fireball</i></a> spell (save DC 15).</p>
    <p>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the <i>fireball</i> by 1 for each bead beyond the first.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)</p>
    <p>This necklace has ld4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>
    <p>Six types of magic beads exist. The DM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <h4 id="Nine Lives Stealer">Nine Lives Stealer</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
    <p>The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</p>

    <h4 id="Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments">Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, very rare</p>
    <p>Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.</p>
    <p>Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features-such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.</p>
    <p>When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.</p>
    <p>Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.</p>
    <p>If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Oathbow">Oathbow</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.</p>
    <p>When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.</p>
    <p>While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.</p>

    <h4 id="Oil of Etherealness">Oil of Etherealness</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Potion, rare</p>
    <p>Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Etherealness" target="_blank"><i>etherealness</i></a> spell for 1 hour.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Potion, uncommon</p>
    <p>This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Freedom of Movement" target="_blank"><i>freedom of movement</i></a> spell for 8 hours. Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.</p>

    <h4 id="Pipes of Haunting">Pipes of Haunting</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Pipes of the Sewers">Pipes of the Sewers</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.</p>
    <p>The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of <a href="../MonsterManual/MM-Monsters Appendix A Miscellaneous.html#Rat" target="_blank">rats</a> with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. The pipes regain ld3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
    <p>Whenever a swarm of rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.</p>

    <h4 id="Portable Hole">Portable Hole</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, rare</p>
    <p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to unfold a <i>portable hole</i> and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the <i>portable hole</i> creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open <i>portable hole</i> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to close a <i>portable hole</i> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space no matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p>
    <p>If the hole is folded up, a creature with in the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <i>portable hole</i> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed <i>portable hole</i> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>
    <p>Placing a <i>portable hole</i> inside an extradimensional space created by a <a href="#Bag of Holding">bag of holding</a>, <a href="#Hewards Handy Haversack">Heward's handy haversack</a>, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>

    <p><b><i>Tree.</i></b> You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground.

    <p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>
    <p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>
    <p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>

In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pound. Ylore weight or lack of solid anchorin cau es the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>

    <p>For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).</p>
    <p>When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed.</p>

That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
    <p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
    <p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrai ned.</p>
    <p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.</p>
    <p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>

    <h4 id="Weapon">Weapon, +1, +2, or +3</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)</p>
    <p>You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Weapon of Warning">Weapon of Warning</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Weapon (any), uncommon (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>This magic weapon warns you of danger. While the weapon is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 30 feet of you can't be surprised, except when incapacitated by something other than nonmagical sleep. The weapon magically awakens you and your companions within range if any of you are sleeping naturally when combat begins.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Well of Many Worlds">Well of Many Worlds</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, legendary</p>
    <p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
    <p>You can use an action to unfold and place the <i>well of many worlds</i> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once well of many worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Wind Fan">Wind Fan</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>While holding this fan , you can use an action to cast the <a href="../PlayerHandbook/PHB-CH11-Spells.html#Gust of Wind" target="_blank"><i>gust of wind</i></a> spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p></p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Winged Boots">Winged Boots</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)</p>
    <p>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.</p>
    <p>The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.</p>
    <!------------------------>
    <h4 id="Wings of Flying">Wings of Flying</h4>
    <p style="margin-top:0px;font-style: italic">Wondrous item, uncommon</p>
    <p>While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.</p>
