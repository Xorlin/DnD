    <h1><u>Chapter 4: Personality and Background</u></h1>
    <p>Characters are defined much more than their race and class. Theyâ€™re
      individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and
      capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter
      expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another,
      including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of
      backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and
      alignment.</p>
