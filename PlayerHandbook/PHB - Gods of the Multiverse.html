    <h1>Appendix B: Gods of the Multiverse</h1>
    <div class="content note-editor notes">
      <p>Religion is an important part of life in the worlds of the D&amp;D
        multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil
        cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining
        paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be
        ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence. </p>
      <p>Many people in the worlds of D&amp;D worship different gods at
        different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for
        example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to
        Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a
        severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite
        among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And
        a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually
        serving as a priest or champion of that god’s ideals.</p>
      <p> Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her
        campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity
        for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can
        pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a
        mental note of the gods w ho are revered in your DM’s campaign so you
        can invoke their names when appropriate. If you’re playing a cleric or a
        character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity
        serves or served, and consider the deity’s suggested domains when
        selecting your character’s domain.</p>
