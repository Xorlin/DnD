    <h1>Chapter 3: Classes</h1>
    <p>Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement
      into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled
      to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that
      lesser women and men can’t stand against.</p>
    <p>Class is the primary definition o f what your character can do. It’s more
      than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you
      think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with
      other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might
      view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see
      herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might
      see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict
      brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a
      mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests,
      paladins, and devotees who share his faith.</p>
    <p>Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s
      mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your
      class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level
      you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry
      in this chapter includes a table (see below) summarizing the benefits you gain at
      every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.</p>

	<p>Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might
      switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin. A barbarian
      might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class
      while continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known to combine
      martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards
      simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called
      multiclassing, appear in <a href="">Chapter 6: Customization Options</a>.</p>
    <p>Twelve classes—listed in the Classes table—are found in almost every D&amp;D
    world and define the spectrum of typical adventurers.</p>
