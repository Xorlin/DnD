    <h1>Chapter 8: Adventuring</h1>
    <p>Delving into ancient tombs of horrors, slipping through the back alleys
      of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the Isle
      of Dread—these are the things that Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures are
      made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and
      uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul
      monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich
      rewards before embarking on a new adventure. </p>
    <p>This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the
      mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules
      for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the
      activities your character might pursue between adventures. </p>
    <p>Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex
      relationships of a royal court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as
      outlined in the book’s introduction: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The DM describes the environment. </li>
      <li>The players describe what they want to do. </li>
      <li>The DM narrates the results of their actions. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the
      characters’ progress as they explore dungeon corridors or wilderness
      regions. The DM’s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the
      adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of
      time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might
      use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.</p>
