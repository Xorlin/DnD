      <h1>Chapter 6: Customization Options</h1>
      <p>The combination of ability score, race, class, and background defines
        your character’s capabilities in the game, and the personal details you
        create set your character apart from every other character. Even within
        your class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your character
        can do. But this chapter is for players who—with the DM’s
        permission—want to go a step further. This chapter defines two optional
        sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats.
        Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special
        options you can choose instead o f increasing your ability s cores as
        you gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in
        a campaign.</p>
