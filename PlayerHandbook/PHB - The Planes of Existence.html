      <h1>Appendix C: The Planes of Existence</h1>
      <p>Incredibly vast is the cosmos of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, which
        teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions
        of reality, called the <span style="font-weight: bold">planes of
          existence</span>. It encompasses every world where Dungeon Masters run
        their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the
        Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter
        and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and
        angels, and the dominions of the gods. </p>
      <p>Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon
        the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and
        allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater
        power and higher levels, you might undertake a quest to rescue a friend
        from the horrific depths of the Abyss, or find yourself hoisting a
        tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard. You might w alk on streets
        made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen
        are resurrected with each dawn.</p>
