    <h1>Appendix A: Conditions</h1>
    <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
    <p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. </p>
    <p></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 0px;">Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 0px;">If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 0px;">A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 0px;">An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;margin-right: 0px;">Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p>
