    <h1>Appendix A: Conditions</h1>
    <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can
      arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or
      other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
      few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. A condition lasts either
      until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up,
      for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the
      condition.</p>
    <p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
      instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s
      effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. </p>
    <p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
      subjected to a condition.</p>
