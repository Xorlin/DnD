    <h1>Building Bruenor</h1>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color: Black">Building Bruenor, Step 1</h3>
    <p>Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff
      mountain dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the
      racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25
      feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.</p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color: Black">Building Bruenor, Step 2</h3>
    <p>Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, one horn on his
      helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a fighter and notes the fighter’s
      proficiencies and 1st-level class features on his character sheet. </p>
    <p>As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d 10— and starts with hit
      points equal to 10 + his Constitution modifier. Bob notes this, and will
      record the final number after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score
      (see step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level
      character, which is +2.</p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color: Black">Building Bruenor, Step 3</h3>
    <p>Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for
      Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15,
      in Strength. His next highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be
      a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, wiser,
      and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and Charisma. After
      applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and
      his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers look like this:
      Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8
      (-1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1). </p>
    <p>Bob fills in Bruenor's final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total o f 13 hit points.</p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color: Black">Building Bruenor, Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his sex (male),
      his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength
      and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low
      Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness. </p>
    <p>Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was
      expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working
      as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a
      heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero
      background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature
      this background gives him. </p>
    <p>Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality in mind, so he
      skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting
      instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his
      friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling
      demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his
      background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law. </p>
    <p>Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires to someday
      reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the
      dwarves out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a
      soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even
      when it might not be warranted.</p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: none;color: Black">Building Bruenor, Step 5</h3>
    <p>Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter class and the
      folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a
      shield, which combine to give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18. </p>
    <p>For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes.
    His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for
    his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus
    his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8
    slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when
    he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe,
    Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown weapons, use Strength
    for attacks and damage), and the weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when
    it hits.</p>
